# surfaceViz
A repo to showcase _3d surface plot_ experiments inside Rhino/IronPython. Note: we don't employ any standard Python libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, etc; as they are not compatible with the IronPython which is as .NET port of Python. We mimiced the standard generation functions to build a set of visualization methods in RhinoCommon instead.
